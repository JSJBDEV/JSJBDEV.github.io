<p>This database was given to me a long time ago by the orginal owner of minecraftruns.ml, and as such contains all the info that was on the website then</p>
 <p>NOTE: there is a bug where you must type a space in front of a non numerical search to actually return your results (so ids you dont need one)</p>
 <p>if you like this idea send a message to me on discord and I will start working on making this look pretty and allow submissions again</p>
