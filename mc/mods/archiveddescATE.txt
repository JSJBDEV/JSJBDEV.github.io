Hello There! I have finally gotten around to updating this mod to 1.12, expect new TNTs soon!

In other news, I have a website now, it's very "minimalistic" but you can find discord links and such there, Go Here!

 

 

You clicked the mod link because you wanted explosions, and so, YOU WILL HAVE EXPLOSIONS!

so minecraft 1.10 didn't have a proper explosives mod so I made minecraft-style tiered explosives.

 

If you have any ideas I shall implement them, the project is currently in early alpha (or beta so you can get it from curse) so the source won't be released. when it hits release I shall put it on github, until them comment problems.

 

BE WARNED: MY TNT IS INSTANT (more "real" / use other timed explosives or det powder)

 

this mod uses a real life term called RE factor, which just so happens to be how big an explosion is relative to TNT, which minecraft already has.

from this image we can see 2 extra things on the item, the RE factor (relative explosion power to TNT) and if it is ignitable. later this will be disable-able by config

 

Anyway, on to the TNT!



 

here we have 5 tiered TNT 4 special TNT and a vacuum cleaner to clean up the mess

 

TIERED TNT:

Basically the explosion gets bigger as the tier goes up. crafted with 4 TNT and 5 of that level of item (end being Endstone bricks)

 

DETONATION POWDER:

Low tier explosive made with 3 gunpowder and 6 iron. useful for blowing up TNT from a safe distance

 

GRAVITATIONAL TNT:

Just in case the blast wasn't enough, you'll also be volunteered for the minecraft space program as an added bonus

 

RADIATING TNT:

Let's face it, its what the average minecrafter would call a "nuke" but I wanted to feel special, ok? (it gives you wither)

 

BRITISH TNT:

I would honestly just craft it. you'll understand why it's British

 

EXPLOSIVE IRON BARREL:

Be the Michael Bay you've always wanted. shoot the barrel it explodes.

 

VACUUM CLEANER:

Item entities lag, so what else could you need?
