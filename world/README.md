# Towns Of The World (Ammended)
This database is an ammended version of an older databse created by MaxMind.com (Please see the license for terms of use)
It has been ammended by me to be more accurate, remove errors and add other countries.
remember this datbase was created in 2008 and so some countries did not exist (South Sudan and the Netherlands Antillies split)

## What is here?
The original text database can still be found [on MaxMinds website](https://www.maxmind.com/en/free-world-cities-database) This database contains every country that existed at the databases creation split into individual files *and* those countries split into individual regions.

the countries as plaintext files can be found under
`/world/countries/{2 LETTER COUNTRY CODE}.txt`
and the regions can be found under
`/world/regions/{2 LETTER COUNTRY CODE}/{COUNTRY REGION}.txt`
